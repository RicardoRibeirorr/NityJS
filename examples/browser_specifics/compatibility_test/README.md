# Browser Compatibility Test

This example demonstrates NityJS's browser compatibility detection system and provides visual feedback about your browser's capabilities.

## What This Test Does

### Automatic Detection
- **OffscreenCanvas Support**: Critical for LayerManager performance
- **Performance API**: High-resolution timing for smooth animations  
- **Modern Canvas Features**: Advanced 2D rendering capabilities
- **ES6 Class Support**: Modern JavaScript syntax requirements

### Visual Feedback
- **Green Indicators**: Feature fully supported
- **Red Indicators**: Feature not available (fallback active)
- **Console Report**: Detailed analysis with recommendations

### Browser Recommendations
- **Chrome 69+**: Full support (recommended)
- **Firefox 105+**: Full support
- **Safari 16.4+**: Full support (mobile included)
- **Edge 79+**: Full support

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Capability Detection
```javascript
const capabilities = BrowserCompatibility.detectCapabilities();
// Returns detailed compatibility information
```

### Graceful Fallbacks
```javascript
// Layer system automatically falls back if OffscreenCanvas unavailable
game.configure({
    useLayerSystem: true  // Works on all browsers with appropriate fallbacks
});
```

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Timing system adapts to available APIs
// Uses performance.now() when available, Date.now() as fallback
```

## Running the Test

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. View visual compatibility indicators
3. Check Developer Console (F12) for detailed report
4. Compare results with browser support matrix

## Interpreting Results

### Fully Compatible (All Green)
- ✅ Ready for production development
- ✅ All features work optimally
- ✅ Best performance available

### Partially Compatible (Some Yellow/Red)
- ⚠️ Core features work fine
- ⚠️ Some features use fallback mode
- ⚠️ Consider browser upgrade for optimal experience

### Limited Compatibility (Mostly Red)
- ❌ Basic functionality may be impaired
- ❌ Browser upgrade strongly recommended
- ❌ Wait for v1.1 polyfill support

## Polyfill Roadmap (v1.1)

Coming improvements for better compatibility:

- **OffscreenCanvas Polyfill**: Enables full layer system on older browsers
- **Performance API Polyfill**: Consistent timing across all browsers
- **ES5 Build Option**: Support for legacy browsers
- **Automatic Polyfill Loading**: Smart detection and loading

## Browser-Specific Notes

### Safari iOS < 16.4
- Layer system falls back to single canvas
- All other features work normally
- Performance slightly reduced but identical functionality

### Chrome Mobile
- Identical to desktop Chrome
- Full feature support on modern versions
- Excellent performance on mobile devices

### Firefox
- Excellent compatibility across versions
- OffscreenCanvas support from version 105+
- Recommended for development and production

## Next Steps

After testing compatibility:

1. **Green Results**: Start with [Simple Layer Example](../simple_layers/)
2. **Mixed Results**: Try [Basic Examples](../basic.js) first
3. **Red Results**: Review [Browser Compatibility Guide](../../docs/core/BrowserCompatibility.md)

## Contributing

Help improve browser compatibility:

- Test on different browsers and report results
- Submit browser-specific optimizations
- Help validate polyfill implementations
- Document edge cases and workarounds

This compatibility test ensures you have the best possible experience with NityJS across all browsers.
